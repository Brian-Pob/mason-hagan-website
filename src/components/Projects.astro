          Django based web application that allows users to submit and view math tutorial videos, separated into four
          different categories of mathematics. Users can title and describe the videos, as well as give a caption that
          will go under the video in the detail view of each post. I learned the most about Django and MVC architecture
          from this project by far, and I believe that I got some good practice with styling elements in CSS, and
          properly structuring HTML divs. The project was live on the domain ivymath.net for about a year, and was
          hosted on Linode.
